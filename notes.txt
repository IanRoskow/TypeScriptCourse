Section 2
Why do we care abour types
-Helps analyze for errors
-Helps other engineers understand our codebase

Where do we use types... Everywhere!

Section 3
Annotations 
-We the developer tell TS the type

Inference
-TS guesses the type

We will be using Inference for all cases except the following:
1) Function that returns the 'any' type i.e. JSON.parse();
2) Delayed initialization
3) When the vaiable type can not be inferred, corner case


Section 4
Annotations with functions and objects

No type inference on aurguments for functions, only type inference from return but we do not use it
We will always annotate the return to ensure we require the return
